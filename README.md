### The goal
- To explore what kind of books sell the most (aka what do the people want to read?)

### Questions to ask
- Which genre sells the most?
- What is the year of publication for each of these bestsellers?
- What is the distribution of sales for each language of origin?
- Which author has the most sales of all time?

### Assumptions
- All time best selling books from 1304 to 2018.
- The dataset lacks specific location data for measuring sales, which, given the figures are in the millions, suggests they likely represent global bestsellers.
- The term "best-selling" refers to the expected number of copies sold for each book, not the number of books printed or currently owned. This list excludes comic books and textbooks. The books are arranged in the order of the greatest sales estimate reported by credible, independent sources ([source](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/drahulsingh/best-selling-books/data)).

### Highlighted results
- Fantasy is the bestselling genre, with the highest sales compared to the others, despite having less number of entries in the list.
- There are a mixed of books that published from long time ago and books that are published recently. People **will** buy books that are interesting to read.
- English is the most dominant language of origin for these all time bestselling books, with 131 books (out of 175 books) made it to the bestselling list.
- J.K. Rowling is the bestselling author, with the highest sales and the most books appearing on the list.
